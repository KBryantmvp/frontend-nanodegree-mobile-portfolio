## Optimizations in views/js/main.js

1) All the query selectors were changed by getElementById or getElementByClassName since it is a faster way to access elements.

2) Modified the function changePizzaSizes in order to make faster calculations:
    - Created an array with all the randomPizzaContainers
    - Passed to the determineDx function only the first element of the array created earlier since rest of elements are equal and we would be wasting time by repeating the same calculations over and over again.
    - Same for newwidth. We only calculate it for the first randomPizzaContainer
    - Finally, in the 'for' loop, we apply the newwidth to each randomPizzaContainer.

3) Modified the function updatePositions in order to make faster calculations too:
    - Created a variable 'x' to store the value of (document.body.scrollTop / 1250) and took it out of the 'for' loop so we do not need to calculate it in each iteration.
    - There are only 5 possible phases for each pizza item, so we also did these calculations outside of the 'for' loop. I just modified the way I did this in my first submission since the suggestions from the udacity reviewer were actually a more elegant solution.

4) Reduced the number of pizzas created to 40 instead of 200.


## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
